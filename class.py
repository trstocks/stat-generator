'''
Now decide the class. You can find the classes on page 45 of the Players Handbook.
Each class will have a primary stat, hit die, saving throw proficiencies,
and armor and weapons proficiencies. You can find each of these on the class page.
You will want to write these down on the bottom left of the character sheet.

Next you will want to look at the features your class has.
Each class starts with features at level one and will gain access to more as they level up.
Write down the characterâ€™s level one class features under the features section of
the character sheet. Also write down your proficiency bonus.
You will find it on the class page as well.
