Now you will want to decide on a background.
Backgrounds are exactly that, background information on your character.
Who was your character before now? The list of backgrounds start on page 125.
Each background offers proficiencies and a feature, amongst other things.

For each background you are supposed to roll dice to see which traits you
acquire from the chosen background but personally I pick and choose or make
my own up so I can build the character I want to. The choice is yours.
Write down the chosen traits, ideal, bond, flay, proficiencies, feature,
and anything else your background gives you.
