'''
Decide the race of your character. Write it, and the raceâ€™s speed, down onto the character sheet.
You can find all the available races on page 17 in the Players Handbook.
Each race has racial traits that affect your ability scores, skills checks,
speed and/or proficiencies (We will be covering these later in the creation process.) 
This means that certain races are better suited for certain classes,
but you can play as who you want.
